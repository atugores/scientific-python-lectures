A set of lectures on scientific computing with Pytho, using Jupyter notebooks.

First of all, install Jupyter by following this instructions: [Installation and virtual envs](https://github.com/atugores/Python-Lectures/blob/master/00.Installation_and_virtualenvs.ipynb)

Then, to open these notebooks in Jupyter, download the files to a directory on your computer and from that directory run:
